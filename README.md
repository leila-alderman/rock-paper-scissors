# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is a simple in-browser game of Rock, Paper, Scissors created using JavaScript and HTML. 

This project contains my code for both a [console version](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) of the game and the [in-browswer version](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation), which are both part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
